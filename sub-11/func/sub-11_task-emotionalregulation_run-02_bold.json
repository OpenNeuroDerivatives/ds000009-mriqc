    "TaskDescription": "Behavioral participants performed one run of the ER task (Ochsner et al., 2004) and MRI participants performed two additional runs during MRI scanning. Before the task, participants were trained on the technique of cognitive reappraisal to teach them how to reduce their negative affect when viewing aversive images. Cognitive reappraisal involves redefining the image in a non-emotional, less negative manner and has been used successfully in previous studies to reduce negative affect (Gross, 1998, 2002; Ochsner, Bunge, Gross, & Gabrieli, 2002; Ochsner et al., 2004; Phan et al., 2005). For example, an image of a person with a gruesome bullet wound may be described as an actor in a movie where the person is covered in fake blood. Participants were trained until they understood the concept of cognitive reappraisal and were able to successfully reappraise aversive images without the help of the experimenter.\nParticipants saw 60 novel images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993). 20 images were neutral and 40 were aversive. IAPS images are rated on a 9-point likert scale for both valence and arousal, with most unpleasant and least arousing corresponding to the lowest ratings. Neutral images were chosen from those rated between 4.38 and 6.53 for valence (mean = 5.03 [SD = 0.50]) and 1.72 and 3.85 for arousal (mean = 2.81 [SD = 0.42]). Negative images were rated between 1.31 and 4.60 for valence (mean = 2.36 [SD = 0.76]) and 4.45 and 7.35 for arousal (mean = 5.93 [SD = 0.79]). There were two instruction conditions in this experiment: suppress and attend. In the suppress condition, participants were instructed to attempt to suppress any negative emotions they may feel using cognitive reappraisal. Crucially, participants were told not to take their eyes off the images or to distract themselves with irrelevant thoughts. During attend trials, participants were instructed to look at the images and respond naturally. 20 trials were attend to neutral images (attend neutral trials), 20 were attend to negative images (attend negative trials), and 20 were suppress to negative images (suppress negative trials). Trial order was randomized for the behavioral version and optimized to detect differences in BOLD response to suppress negative trials as compared to attend negative trials for the MRI version. Average IAPS image ratings were equivalent for the behavioral and MRI runs for each participant, as were the average ratings for the attend negative images and the suppress negative images within each run (ANOVA comparing suppress negative and attend negative for behavioral and MRI runs: F(3,76) = .02, p > .99 for valence and F(3,76) = .004, p > .99 for arousal; t-test comparing attend neutral images between the behavioral and MRI runs: t(38) = .49, p = .63 for valence and t(38) = .03, p = .98 for arousal). Each group of images contained 50% faces and 50% non-faces. There were four different list orders, each containing a different combination of images, to ensure that there were no order effects.\nDuring the task, each trial began with the instructions for that trial (suppress or attend) displayed for 1 second. Participants were instructed to view the images as they were for the ”attend” trials and utilize cognitive reappraisal for the ”suppress” trials. They then viewed the image (either aversive or neutral) for 5 seconds. There was then a fixation crosshair for 2 seconds, followed by a self-report screen for 3 seconds, which asked the participants how negative they felt after either suppressing or attending to the image on a 4-point likert scale from 1 (very slightly or not at all negative) to 4 (extremely negative). The trial ended with a 3 second fixation crosshair before the next trial began. The only difference between the behavioral and MRI versions was that the behavioral version was one run with two brief breaks, whereas the MRI version was separated into two runs of 392 seconds each (Figure 4). Before and after the task, participants were administered the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; D. Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), which asks people to report the extent to which they are currently experiencing 20 emotions in order to assess changes in mood. After the MRI scan, MRI participants viewed all images they had seen during the scan and rated the negativity of each one (when attending to the image) on a 7-point likert scale from 1 (not at all negative) to 7 (extremely negative).\nIn order to minimize demand characteristics, participants were instructed before the task that emotion regulation is not always successful and that we specifically chose difficult images so they may not always be able to suppress their negative emotions. It was emphasized that they should rate the strength of their negative emotion honestly and not worry about whether they were successful in decreasing their negative emotions.\nThe MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997) version 7.5 was used to present the stimuli to participants and to record their responses for all tasks.",
