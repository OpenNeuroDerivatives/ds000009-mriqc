    "TaskDescription": "Behavioral participants performed one run of the BART (Lejuez et al., 2002) and MRI participants performed one additional run during MRI scanning. Participants saw a balloon on the monitor and were given the option to either inflate it by pressing the left button with their right index finger or to stop inflating it by pressing the right button with their right middle finger.\nFor the MRI version, the balloon began at a value of 50 cents and its value was increased by 25 cents for each pump. If the participant decided to stop inflating the balloon, the accrued money was moved to a permanent store of winnings and a new balloon was presented. After a variable number of pumps the balloon exploded, in which case the participant lost all the money in the temporary pool. The actual number of pumps before an explosion followed a uniform distribution across trials, with an average of 32 pumps for the behavioral version (SD = 10 pumps) and 6 pumps for the MRI version (SD = 2 pumps). There were two balloon colors for the behavioral version (blue and red) and only one for the MRI version (blue). Each balloon color was presented 36 times for a total of 72 trials for the behavioral version and 36 trials for the MRI version.\nThe number of trials and the average number of pumps before explosion varied between the behavioral and MRI versions because the timing for each version was quite different from that of the other. For the behavioral version, the balloon remained on the monitor until the participant made a choice. If the choice was to inflate the balloon, the next balloon appeared after 100 ms. After each pump, the balloon size increased by 2%. If the balloon exploded, after a delay of 100 ms the participant saw an image of an exploded balloon for 1500 ms, along with the amount of money won so far. If the participant chose to cash out and stop inflating the balloon, the balloon remained on the screen with the updated amount of money earned for 1500 ms. The next trial began after a delay of 500 ms. There were two brief breaks during the behavioral version.\nFor the MRI version, the balloon once again remained on the monitor until the par- ticipant made a choice. The time between events was longer than during the behavioral version and variable so we could pull apart neural responses to each of the event types. If the choice was to inflate the balloon, the next balloon appeared after a jittered delay of between 1000 ms and 3000 ms (mean 2000 ms, uniform distribution). After each pump, the balloon size increased by 15%. If the balloon exploded, after a jittered delay from the same distribution as used when inflating the balloon, the participant saw an image of an exploded balloon for 2000 ms, along with the amount of money won so far. If the participant chose to cash out and stop inflating the balloon, the balloon remained on the screen with the updated amount of money earned for 2000 ms. The next trial began after a jittered delay of between 1000 ms and 12000 ms (mean 2000 ms, exponential distribution). Run length was variable for this task since it was based on participant responses, but the maximum length was capped at 600 seconds (mean = 500 seconds [SD = 30 seconds]; Figure 2).\nParticipants received the actual amount of money earned during this task in order to ensure that they took the task seriously and viewed pumping the balloon as risky.",
