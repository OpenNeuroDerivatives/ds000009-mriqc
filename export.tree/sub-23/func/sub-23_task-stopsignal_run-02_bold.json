    "TaskDescription": "Behavioral participants performed three runs of the SS task (Logan, Dagenbach, & Carr, 1994) and MRI participants performed two more during MRI scanning. The primary task was a simple two-choice reaction time task with spatially compatible stimulus-response mappings. On go trials, participants pressed the right button with their right middle finger if an arrow pointed rightwards and the left button with their right index finger if the arrow pointed leftwards. On each go trial, an open circle appeared on the computer monitor for 500 ms to indicate that the primary stimulus was about to appear (visual angle subtended 4.9 x 4.9). Then the arrow, pointing left or right, appeared in the center of the circle until the participant responded or 1000 ms elapsed. The duration of the blank screen between the trials was 500 ms for the behavioral version and was jittered between 500 and 4000 ms (mean 1000 ms, sampled from an exponential distribution) for the MRI version so as to optimize our ability to compare successful inhibition trials to go trials with fMRI.\nOn 25% of the trials, a tone was sounded (stop trials) and participants tried to inhibit their already initiated response to the arrow. The tone was presented at varying delays (the stop-signal delay; SSD) after the onset of the go stimulus. If participants responded on a stop trial, the trial proceeded as if it were a go trial. If participants inhibited their response, the arrow remained on the screen for 1000 ms, followed by the jittered interval between trials (Figure 1).\nAn adaptive, tracking staircase procedure was used to adjust the SSD at which the presentation of the stop-signal resulted in approximately 50% inhibition of responses. Two independent staircase functions with a step size of 50 ms were used to determine SSD. Starting delays for the two ladders on the first run of the stop-signal task were 250 ms and 350 ms respectively. The delay of each staircase was increased by 50 ms if a participant successfully inhibited his or her response to make it more difficult to inhibit a response on the next stop trial. If a participant responded on a stop trial, however, the delay was decreased by 50 ms to make it easier to inhibit a response on the next stop trial. For each subsequent run, the last SSD of each staircase on the previous block was used as each staircase’s starting value. By using a dynamic SSD, we ensured that each participant was able to successfully inhibit his or her responses on approximately 50% of the stop trials. The two staircases began at slightly different delays in order to maximize the chance that at least one would begin close to a participant’s ideal SSD.\nEach run had 128 trials: 96 go trials and 32 stop trials and lasted between 352 and 362 seconds, depending on the length of the jittered inter-trial intervals. For each eight trials, there were four left arrows and four right arrows. There were also two stop trials (one for each ladder). Order of arrow direction, stop-trial ladder, and on which trials the stop-signal occurred were randomized. For behavioral trials there were four different list orders and for MRI trials each participant had a unique list order to ensure that there were no order effects.",
