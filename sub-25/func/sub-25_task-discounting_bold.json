    "TaskDescription": "Behavioral participants performed one run of the TD task (Kable & Glimcher, 2007; McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, & Cohen, 2004) and MRI participants performed one additional run during MRI scanning. Participants made a series of decisions regarding whether they would prefer to receive a smaller amount of money immediately or a larger, variable amount of money after a variable delay. For all trials, the two payment/delay options were presented adjacent to each other on the computer monitor and participants were instructed to press the left of two buttons with their right index finger if they preferred the option displayed on the left of the monitor (the immediate option) and to press the right button with their right middle finger if they preferred the option displayed on the right of the monitor (the delayed option). The behavioral and MRI versions were very different from each other because we took advantage of learning about the individual discounting parameter for each participant during the behavioral version to determine the choices presented during the MRI version.\nFor the behavioral version, the immediate amount was either $5 or $10. There were six possible delays (2 days, 1 week, 3 weeks, 2 months, 4 months & 1 year). The delays were evenly distributed along a log scale then adjusted to give delays that would be easily interpreted (i.e., 2 months instead of 71 days). The dollar amount of the delayed option ranged from $5 to $120 and was determined adaptively with a staircasing procedure (Du, Green, & Myerson, 2002; Estle, Green, Myerson, & Holt, 2007). Based on previous lit- erature, it was assumed that each participant’s pattern of discounting the value of the delayed option followed a hyperbolic curve (Kable & Glimcher, 2007; Monterosso et al., 2007). The parameter describing the steepness of the curve (k; discounting parameter) has an average value of approximately 0.013 based on previous results from studies in healthy adults (Kable & Glimcher, 2007; Kirby, Petry, & Bickel, 1999; Monterosso et al., 2007). Assuming a hyperbolic discounting function, the equation to determine the subjective value of a delayed option is: SV =V/(1+kD) where SV = the subjective value of the payment after accounting for its discounted value, V = the numerical value of the payment, k = the individual’s discounting parameter, and D = the delay in days of the payment. We calculated the indifference point of each option, where the subjective value of the delayed amount was equal to the actual value of the immediate amount; this would result in an option where a person with the same discounting parameter would feel that the two options were equivalent. This allowed us to calculate the actual value of the delayed amount given the delay and the immediate amount: V =SV ∗(1+kD) where SV is equal to the immediate amount on any given trial. There were 96 adaptive trials: 50% with each immediate value ($5 and $10) and 8 occurrences of each delay for each starting value. The order of trials was random. The task began by assigning a k- value of 0.013 (the average in the healthy adult population) to each of two staircases, one assigned to all immediate $5 options and a second assigned to all immediate $10 options. A combination of the k-value, the delay, and the immediate amount was used to determine the delayed amount presented to the participant. The only constraint to this approach was that the maximum delayed amount was capped at $120. After each trial, the k-value was updated based on the QUEST toolbox in MATLAB (A. B. Watson & Pelli, 1983). The QUEST parameters were as follows: starting estimate (0.013), standard deviation (.02), probability of choosing delayed (0.5), Weibull function parameters (beta = 5, delta = 0.01, gamma = 0.01), step size (0.001), and range of responses (1). If a participant chose the immediate amount, the indifference k-value on that trial was smaller than the person’s actual k-value and it was increased on the next trial. If a participant chose the delayed amount, the indifference k-value was decreased on the next trial. This procedure was used so that the staircases would converge at the person’s indifference k-value by the end of the run. Order of immediate amount and delay was random. As a check of this adaptive procedure, 54 trials with a set indifference k-value were randomly interspersed throughout the task. There were nine pre-defined k-values (.005, .0075, .01, .02, .03, .04, .05, .075, .1; Kirby et al., 1999). Each k-value was tested once per delay and randomly assigned to a starting value of $5 or $10, since pilot testing showed no difference between the converged k-values for the two starting values. Order of k-value, delay, and immediate amount was random. This allowed us to compare the k-values determined through the adaptive and through the set method, which were highly correlated (r = 0.89, p < .00001). The means of the two values were not significantly different from each other (t(76)=0.95, p = .3). Two different list orders were used to ensure that there were no order effects.\nEach choice was displayed to participants until a choice was made or 8000 ms. After 3000 ms if no response was made, a prompt appeared underneath the options to remind participants to respond. After the choice was made, a fixation crosshair was displayed for 1000 ms before the next trial began. There was one brief break in the middle of the run.\nFor the MRI version, we took advantage of having an estimate of each participant’s discounting parameter (k). We defined trials as hard or easy based on each person’s previously estimated indifference k-value. Hard trials gave choices that were only a small amount different from the indifference delayed amount (1% or 5%). Easy trials gave choices that were quite different from the indifference delayed amount (95%, 99%, 190%, or 200%). The same immediate amounts and delays were used as in the behavioral version. There were 96 trials. For each of the two immediate values each delay was tested 8 times at different degrees of difficulty. For each immediate value/delay combination, there were two hard amounts that were less than the indifference delayed amount (1% and 5%; hard immediate), two hard amounts that were more than the indifference delayed amount (1% and 5%; hard delayed), two easy amounts that were less than the indifference delayed amount (95% and 99%; easy immediate), and two easy amounts that were more than the indifference delayed amount (190% and 200%; easy delayed). Note that for the easy amounts the percent change was different for easy immediate and easy delayed trials. This is because if the easy immediate amount was more than 100% less than the indifference value, then the delayed amount could be less than the immediate amount. We constrained the minimum delayed amount so it could be no less than the immediate amount. Trial order was generated using an m-sequence (Liu, 2004; Liu & Frank, 2004), a pseudorandom sequence optimized to maximize the tradeoff between power and efficiency, with 13 trial types (6 delays x hard vs. easy + null events). Because no differences were seen between immediate values of $5 or $10, order of those was pseudorandom, constrained so that 50% of hard immediate, 50% of hard delayed, 50% of easy immediate, and 50% of easy delayed had immediate values of $5 and 50% of each had immediate values of $10. Four different list orders were used to ensure that there would not be order effects.\nAt the beginning and end of the task a fixation crosshair was displayed on the screen for 16 seconds to get a baseline comparison. Each choice was displayed to participants for 4500 ms regardless of when they made their choice. There was a fixation crosshair between trials for 750 ms. There were eight null events (fixation crosshair) with a duration of 5250 ms randomly interspersed throughout the task. The run lasted 580 seconds (Figure 3).\nParticipants received the actual amount of money at the delay chosen for one randomly selected trial on this task (with the delayed amount capped at $120) to ensure that they took the task seriously. Participants were briefed on the payment procedure before the task and all stated in a debriefing questionnaire after the study that they believed it would occur as explained.",
